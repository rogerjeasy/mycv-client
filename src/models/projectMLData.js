This package has been implemented by Manuel Gunther some years ago as part of Bob but it has been deactivated in the last version due to a restructuring and removal of all C++ implementations. In addition, it acks parallelization, hindering its efficiency, and does not support the incorporation of Gabor filters into modern deep learning methods. The goal is to leverage the PyTorch framework to implement the Gabor wavelet processing in the spatial domain and frequency domain, allowing for parallelization on the GPU to explore the full capability of Gabor waveletes."],
